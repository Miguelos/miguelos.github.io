I'm always seeking for the best coding practices for html and css. This is an excelent guide for that.

[http://smacss.com/book/](http://smacss.com/book/)

There is a [list](http://smacss.com/book/resources) at with other useful resources. Like [http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides) for getting started in a propper front-end development.

The next step it's to use good practices with css and html. This languajes are different to others. Developing without thinking every line you create can turn your project into a monster website. It would be imposible to debug and makee a simple css change. I'd be better spending time planing the coding standars and files structure.

## Starting off 

I decided to create my personal website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I usually enjoy Wordpress but I always want to try more!

It's really easy and simple. I followed the tutorial at [JekyllBotstrap.com][JB]. There are useful information and everithing you nedd to know to get started. Check it out!  

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap.git miguelos.github.io
$ cd miguelos.github.com
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:miguelos/miguelos.github.io.git
$ git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Now starts the best part: Geting into the development and customization.

{% highlight bash %}
$ jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

You'll get your new jekyll static page runing on local. Take a look at http://localhost:4000. Easy and fun!

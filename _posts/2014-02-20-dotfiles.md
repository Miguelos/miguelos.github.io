I'm used to work in different computers and synchronizing my dotfiles has become a priority in my todo list.

## Inspiration

There are a lot of dotfiles projects out there!

## My own dotfiles

Previously I've been using a fork of the project tastiness to track my dotfiles. Althoug I __believe__ in forked dotfiles ([dotfiles.org](http://dotfiles.org)), I want to come up with my own way to organize it.

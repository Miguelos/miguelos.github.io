short: MyHomeFiles.
long: MyHomeFiles is a new site, designed by Classic Folios. The purpose of the site is to provide information for new homeowners, putting all information about a home in one place. The site is available for use by home development companies, who wish to communicate with the owners of their houses on a development-by-development basis. I was the main developer in charge of implement the new versions of the site.

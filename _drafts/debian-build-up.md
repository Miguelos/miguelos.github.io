*install debian

I leaved the desktop environment option blank

{debian netinstall png}

but selected laptop option:
{}
wireless-tools
acpi-support
nvclock
cpufrequtils
hibernate
acpi
wpasupplicant
powertop
vbetool
pcmciautils
acpid
apmd
radeontool
toshset
anacron
avahi-autoipd
bluetooth
{}

I don't have bluetooth in my laptop, so lets purge it!

{}
# aptitude purge bluetooth
{}

# Basic installs

## Sudo command
{}# aptitude install sudo{}
add user to sudoers file
{}# adduser username sudo{}


2. Allow sudo for your normal user

Add your user to sudo group:

1
visudo
Add the following line (with your user name instead of ‘toub’):

1
toub ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL


# Window manager

One of the reasons to install Ubuntu Server instead of Desktop is to avoid metapackages like ubuntu-desktop. Instead of strip down Ubuntu Desktop, It's much easier to install whatever you need from the server edition.

*xorg

*openbox

## Terminal

*terminator
*tint2
*kupfler

## Basic programs
*chromium
*music

First of all, at least install Linux kernel 3.9 or newer to support SSD caching. It's possible that TRIM support will be enabled by default for SSD in future kernel releases(1)[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTUxOTY]. so always it's good to use latest version. I'm waiting for the kernel 3.12 that will fix a problem with the 9 in 1 card reader in my XPS L502x.

In addition use the most mature file system: ext4 while waitng for btrfs[https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page].


#check status and firmware:

check partition alignment [http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/10762/check-if-you-partition-are-aligned]
fdisk -l /dev/sda | grep -E sda[0-9]+ | sed s/*// |  awk '{printf ("%s %f ",$1,$2/512); if($2%512){ print "BAD" }else {print "Good"} }' | column -t

everything ok

There is a firmware update for my drive. However, I'll skip it: "Both firmware v1.5 and v1.5.1 offer identical performance for your particular drive"[http://ocz.com/consumer/download/firmware].




# TEst performance
$ sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda

/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   14284 MB in  2.00 seconds = 7146.43 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1080 MB in  3.00 seconds = 359.77 MB/sec

# configure fstab



Disable realtime reducing inecesary writes to the disk. That will increase SSD lifetime.

Verify trim suport 
sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda |grep TRIM
	   *	Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 16 blocks)

TRIM it's not needed. SSD's garbage collection it's enough. So If you leave spare space in the SSD (about 8GB) It won't be neccesary. To enable it add discard option to ftstab. 

add to ssd partitions in /etc/sources.list
noatime,nodiratime,discard




# change scheduler

Enable deadline schedule for solid drives only

{}
for f in /sys/block/sd?/queue/rotational; do printf "$f is "; cat $f; done
/sys/block/sda/queue/rotational is 0
/sys/block/sdb/queue/rotational is 1
{}

If your SSD drive it isn't beeing detected, you can update it here: https://wiki.debian.org/udev

In my case only for sda:

echo "block/sda/queue/scheduler = deadline" >> /etc/sysfs.conf
(adjust sdX to match your SSD) reboot or

echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler

# check changes 

{}
# for f in /sys/block/sd?/queue/scheduler; do printf "$f is "; cat $f; done
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler is noop [deadline] cfq 
/sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler is noop deadline [cfq] 
{}

# Swap

for better longevity of the disc disable swappines. Having 8gb of ram, swap is rarely used
{}
echo 'vm.swappiness=0' > /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
{}

if you want to use swap be sure to put it in the HDD. If you place the swap in the SSD, It almost won't be used unless you hibernate the computer.




# Extra
 changes 
If you're worried about SSD lifetime, check out iotop to see which programs write more
iotop -oPa

realocate /var to a HDD partition


# Update grub2 config 

change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value in /etc/default/grub. Add elevator=deadline

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet elevator=deadline"

# update-grub2

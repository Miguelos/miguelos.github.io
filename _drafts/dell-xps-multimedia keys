Special Touch Keys

The special touch keys are strangely mapped by default. One changes brightness, one does next track. They seem to be linked to the same key sequences as the Fn+F# keys that do the same job. To fix this, make this new file:
/opt/dell_touchkeys_keymap
0x90 previoussong # Previous song
0xA2 playpause # Play/Pause
0x99 nextsong # Next song
0xDB computer # First touch key, Dell apparently uses a key sequence here where 0xDB is a modifer, 0x2D stands for the touch key and 0x19 for the monitor toggle
0x85 prog1 # Second touch key
0x84 chromium # Third touch key
and add this to /etc/rc.local:
/etc/rc.local
â€¦
# Fix touch keys
/usr/lib/udev/keymap input/event0 /opt/dell_touchkeys_keymap
